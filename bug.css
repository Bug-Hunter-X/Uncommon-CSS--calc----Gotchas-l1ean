The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes cause unexpected behavior if not used correctly.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a flexbox context might not work as expected because the 100% might be calculated before the element's parent has fully sized itself.  Another common issue is forgetting to include spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions, which will result in a parsing error. A less common error is when you use `calc()` with units that aren't compatible (e.g., trying to subtract pixels from percentages without careful consideration of context).
